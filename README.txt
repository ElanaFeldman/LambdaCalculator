Lambda: The Semantics Tool
--------------------------

Joint work by Lucas Champollion, Josh Tauberer and Maribel Romero
Department of Linguistics, University of Pennsylvania
Supported by a University of Pennsylvania SAS technology grant.

Lambda is an interactive, graphics-based pedagogical software that helps 
students of formal semantics practice the typed lambda calculus.

Up-to-date information about this project is on the Lambda
website:
  http://www.ling.upenn.edu/lambda/
and its SourceForge page:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/lambdacalc

The project is meant to be built with NetBeans.

To create the packaged Windows EXE, you must get launch4j from 
http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/ and extract the files into the 
"launch4j" subdirectory of this directory.  We've been using version 
2.1.3 of launch4j.
