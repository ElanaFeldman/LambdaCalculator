exercise semantic types
title Semantic Types
directions Give the semantic type of the following lambda-expressions.

Lx. P(x) & Q(x)

exercise lambda conversion
title Lambda Conversion
directions After checking that the type of the function and the type of the
directions argument(s) match, simplify the following expressions performing
directions one lambda-conversion at a time.

Lx. P(x) & Q(x) (a)
LxLy. R(a,y) & Q(x) (a) (b)
Lx.Ey[R(y,x)] (y)
Lx.a (b)
Lx.P(x) -> ExR(x,b) (a)
LxLx.P(x) -> R(x,c) (a) (b)
