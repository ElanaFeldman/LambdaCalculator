define sleep,sleeps : Lx[sleep(x)]
define happy : Lx[happy(x)]
define man : Lx[man(x)]
define love, loves : LyLx[love(x,y)]
define someone : LX[Ex[X(x)]]
# TODO when we define "someone" as  LP[Ex[P(x)]],
# we should get an immediate warning because P is declared above to 
# be a constant
define a : LX.LY.[Ex[X(x)&Y(x)]]
define is : LX.Lx.[X(x)]
# can we define "is" as LX.X?
define John : j	
# define Mary : m
