<p><i>The Penn Lambda Calculator</i> is an interactive, graphical, pedagogical
computer program that helps students of formal semantics practice the typed
lambda calculus. Click on the pictures to the right to see screenshots
(<a href="screenshot1.png">1</a> <a href="screenshot3.png">2</a> <a href="screenshot4.png">3</a>).
<i>Lambda</i>, as we call it for short, was started in June 2006.
It was most recently used in Prof. <a href="/~sanguesa">Maribel Romero</a>'s course 
"Introduction to Semantics" (<a
href="https://coursework.stanford.edu/portal/site/Su07-LSA-328">LSA.328</a>)
at the <a
href="http://linginst07.stanford.edu">2007 LSA Institute</a> in Stanford.</p>

<p>The goal of the <i>Penn Lambda Calculator</i> project is to provide teachers and students
with a software that assists them in mastering the centerpiece of
introductory courses to formal semantics: the lambda calculus. 
The most important feature of this software is its
sophisticated routines that detect common errors and return "smart"
feedback to the student user. It also has a module for performing
derivations of natural language phrases up a syntactic tree in the style
of Heim &amp; Kratzer (1998).</p>

<!--<p>The program is based on <a href="spec.pdf">this initial specification</a>
by Professor Maribel Romero.</p>-->

<p>The program is described thoroughly in our paper in the proceedings of GEAF 2007:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 1.5em">Champollion, L., J. Tauberer and M. Romero. to appear. "The Penn Lambda Calculator: Pedagogical Software for Natural Language Semantics", in T. Holloway King and E. M. Bender (eds.), Proceedings of the Grammar Engineering across Frameworks (GEAF) 2007 Workshop, July 13-15 2007. CSLI On-line Publications
[<a href="http://ling.upenn.edu/~sanguesa/papers/lambda-geaf.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>

<p>But note that the program undergoes ongoing development and several
new features have been added since the publication of the GEAF paper.</p>

<h3>Downloading</h3>

<p>You can download the current version, which is version 1.0.12 (March 29, 2008; <a href="ChangeLog.txt">Change Log</a>):</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
	<p><a href="LambdaCalculator.exe">Windows EXE version</a> (no installation necessary; just download and double-click to start)</p>
	<p><a href="LambdaCalculator.jar">Java JAR version</a> for all other platforms (Mac OS X, Linux).</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2em">On a Mac, just download and double-click to start.</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 2em">On Linux, start with <tt>java -jar LambdaCalculator.jar</tt>. (But make sure you run it with Sun's Java, not GNU libgcj, which you can check with <tt>java -version</tt>.)</p>
</div>

<p>About installing Java:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p>Windows and Linux users will need to make sure they have the <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava">Java JRE 1.4</a> or
newer installed. The Windows version of the calculator will check on
startup if Java is installed, and if necessary, will take the user to a website where
Java can be downloaded.</p>

<p>On Mac OS, Java is already installed in most cases (e.g. Mac OS 10.4
Tiger comes with Java 1.4 or higher installed by default). Otherwise, it
can be installed via the Software Update option in the Apple menu. If you
are not sure if your Mac has the right version of Java, just try and run
the program. If nothing happens or if you get an error message, you'll need
 to update Java.</p>
</div>

<p>The teacher edition, in which tree-derivation exercises are shown in
a presentation mode that automatically computes denotations of nonterminals,
is available upon request to bona fide instructors. Send an email from your
academic email address to:</p>
<img src="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~champoll/email.jpg" style="margin-left: 2em"/>

<p>Regardless of which edition you use, we're interested in hearing from
you. We read all user feedback attentively. If you're an
instructor, a student, or just a Web passerby, send us a line and tell us
about how you use (or would like to use) the
program and how we can improve it.</p>

<p>Source code will be posted shortly.</p>


<h3>Sample Exercise Files</h3>

<p>We have three example exercise files:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><a href="example1.txt">example1.txt</a>: Examples of 'semantic types' and 'lambda conversion' exercises.</p>
<p><a href="example2.txt">example2.txt</a>: Examples of bottom-up tree derivation exercises.</p>
<p><a href="example3.txt">example3.txt</a>: Examples of using bottom-up tree derivations with generalized quantifiers (including set notation).</p>
<p>You can download these and then open them in the <i>Penn Lambda Calculator</i> to try them out.
To download the files, right-click the link (on a PC) or control-click (on a Mac?) and choose "Save Link As..." to save the file to your computer.
Remember where you saved the file. Then (download and) run the <i>Penn Lambda Calculator</i>.
Choose the Interactive Exercise Solver, and in the File menu, choose Open, and
open the exercise file you downloaded.</p>
</div>

<!--<p>Example one implements the example
exercises in our original program specification for semantic types and lambda
conversion. If in doubt, you may use the specification as a
guide for what to type into the program if you would like to try it out.
If you do that, it may seem like the program is following a prewritten
script since the responses of the program follow very closely with the
planned responses in the spec. But the program really is being smarter
than that, trying to detect the various types of errors a student may
make in a general way, not specific to the particular problems in this
exercise file.)</p>

<p>Example two includes sample problems for semantic derivations
on syntactic trees.</p>-->

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p><b>For students and instructors:</b> When typing predicate logic
expressions in the program, some special keyboard combinations are
used to enter logical symbols. See the <a href="specialsymbols.html">guide
to entering special symbols</a> for instructions. Some help is also
provided within the program.</p>

<p><b>For instructors:</b> If you would like to write an exercise file, 
you may read the <a href="exercisefiles.html">documentation for the exercise file format</a>
or consult the <a href="example0.txt">complete and documented sample exercise file for instructors</a>.</p>
